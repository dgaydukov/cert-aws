# AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty

### Description
Here is my experience of taking data machine learning specialty exam
* [MLS-C01](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty)
For ML we use separate file, cause Solutions Architect (both associate & pro) don't cover ML at all. There are a few questions about Polly in associate exam and some regarding Rekognition in professional. 
Other then that, ML is not covered by that exam, that's why we create separate folder & tips file for ML.
