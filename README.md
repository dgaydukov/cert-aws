# AWS Solutions Architect certification


### Description
Here is my experience for taking [SAA-C02](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate) and [SAP](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional) certification.
You can also take a look at [Available AWS Certifications](https://aws.amazon.com/certification) for complete list of available certifications.
Compare to [java cert](https://github.com/dgaydukov/cert-ocpjp11) where you have to pass associate exam before passing professional, in aws you can 
[directly pass professional without passing associate](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/10/announcing-more-flexibility-for-aws-certification-exams) 
But since we get 50% discount after success [here](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/benefits/) 
and [here](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/02/new-aws-certification-policies-offer-more-choices-flexibility/) and since professional costs twice the associate, whatever pass you take you pay the same amount.
If you go with associate + professional => you pay 150 + 300 with 50% discount (so you will pay only 150 for second exam) = 300 totally. 
If you go straight to professional you just pay 300. But I would encourage you to take both, since during preparation for both of them you will learn a lot of new funny stuff.


### Why do you need it.
There are 2 main reasons to get it.
1. During preparation you will learn a lot of new stuff
2. It may help your career
