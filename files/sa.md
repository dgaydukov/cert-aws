### Miscellaneous
###### SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS/IAC 
SaaS (Software as a Service) - if you want to use third-party software like some crm, but don't want to have it staff to install it to every computer in your office you can just use web-service of such crm. In this case crm completely managed by someone else,
you just can access it from web browser without need to run it and support.

PaaS (Platform as a Service) - in this case you develop you application (writing code) and just deploy your code without worry about infrastructure. For example if you are using spring framework, you can use [cloud foundry](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-cloudfoundry/reference/html/)
and just deploy your code, and it will provide everything else (container, java, spring framework).


IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) - good example is aws that provides infrastructure (like container/networking/storage/database) as services to end users. Compare to other 2 PaaS/SaaS users of IaaS responsible for managing infrastructure themselves. 
The best practice is to use IAC (Infrastructure as a code) - is an idea that you should code how you want to build your infrastructure. For example to run you microservice app you need to have 3 containers. 
Of course you can manually create all of them, install all needed software there and deploy it. But you can also add script file that would do it all automatically. Most popular tools is Aws CloudFormation and Terraform.

###### Virtualization and Containerization
Hyperviser is Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), that runs VM. It works as mediator between virtual OS and hardware. By acting as mediator we can run several virtual OS on one hardware. This is the main advantage, cause one OS can run on one hardware only.
Originally hypervisors developped to give multiple users simultaneous access to computers that performed batch processing. But over time other solutions for many users/single machine problem appeared including time sharing.
So virtualization is a simulation of physical hardware for virtual OS.
Containerization on the other hand is like os-level virtualization. Instead of creating a complete new OS, container share resources with host os, but have it's own file system, and by doing so divide itself from main OS.


###### Docker and Kubernetes
Docker - is a tool to quickly create and manage containers (like create/stop/start/destroy). But if you have many containers and they all should interact with each other you need some system to manage all of this.
Kubernetes - is a tool to manage a group of containers. On container level kuber can use docker or any other container tool.


###### Pure Serverless
With aws serverless you can build complete backend application without writing code(like java) or using any framework (like spring). 
For example you can use `API Gateway` to set up a few api endpoints. Then you can use `aws lambda` to set up some logic to handle these endpoints. Then you can use `sns` to send some notification, and possible send emails.
As you see without writing any application code we can have a simple backend application. But the truth is that this is only good for very simple app, usually for POC (proof of concept).
The reason is once your application become more complex it would be very hard to ensure that everything is working fine, cause you have no tests. 
So the conclusion is very simple. Use aws serverless only for POC, or when you want quickly to startup, then you can also create a lot of mock api so your team can start to interact with it.
But once your system become more complex you will definately need to use some programming like java/spring to have a good software architecture of your product and good test coverage that would ensure that nothing would be broken after changes.__
