# AWS Solutions Architect & Security Specialty certification

### Description
Here is my experience of taking 3 certifications:
* [SAA-C02](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate)
* [SAP-C01](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional)
* [SCS-C01](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty)
All 3 are in same document, cause security tightly related to all other services. So you can use this guide to prepare to either solutions architect exam or security specialty exam.
Personally I would advise going to solutions architect first (both associate & pro), cause it would give you deep understanding of how cloud works.
So my roadmap is SAA => SAP => Security. I think it would be useful to pass professional first, cause again you would have deep understanding of how cloud works under-the-hood. 
Associate tier give you just superficial knowledge, you would just know that some services exists and what they do. Professional on the other hand will give you deep insight into each service, of what they do, and most importantly why they do it this way.
In real exam I didn't meet any questions regarding `Rekognition`, but there are few in whizlabs mock exams. So I think due to ML exam all ML related questions are moved there. Yet it can still be useful to learn few ML services when you prepare for SAP exam.
